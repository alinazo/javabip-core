# BIP main repository

This repository contains multiple Maven projects. In the perfect world it would
be just one maven project to be built. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect 
and you need to built the project separately. 

Depending on the state of your environment (Maven repository) you may
be able to skip some of the steps.

Each project has its own README.md that you should look at to know how
to build.
